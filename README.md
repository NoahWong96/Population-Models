# Population-Models
Models of Population Dynamics 


Includes the python program "Leslie Model Rats" which models rat populations using a linear leslie matrix. Uses an age-structured linear population model to predict population age groups of future generatations. Data from "On the Use of Matrices in Certain Populations" by P. H. Leslie includes the initial population count, probability of survival based on age and fecundity rates. 

--Leslie Model Rats uses the library Numpy.py
